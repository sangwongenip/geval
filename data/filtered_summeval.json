It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told . Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct .

But the panel , run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions .

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds , which assess English , maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury , Gloucestershire . This was despite the exam session finishing , a conduct panel heard . Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury , pictured , to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil 's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off . After the suspected breach of exam rules , school officials were tipped off , resulting in an investigation being launched in June . The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same . It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told . Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct . The Department for Education annulled the whole school 's SAT 's results after a probe by the local education authority ( file picture ) However , he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers , but to make them more legible . But the panel , run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions . Panel chair Martin Pilkington said , although the teacher \u2019 s conduct had been dishonest , it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty . But he added : 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school , that can in no way excuse his behaviour . 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority . ' Paul Heathcote , acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan , banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years . He said : 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014 . 'Mr Guffick \u2019 s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress . 'In all the circumstances , I agree with the panel \u2019 s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction . 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions . ' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court .",

        "source": "The glowing blue letters that once lit the Bronx from above Yankee Stadium failed to find a buyer at an auction at Sotheby 's on Wednesday . While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $ 300,000 to $ 600,000 , the only person who raised a paddle - for $ 260,000 - was a Sotheby 's employee trying to jump start the bidding . The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson , who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008 . No love : 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $ 300,000 to $ 600,000 , but received no bids at a Sotheby 's auction Wednesday The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted ' a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City . ' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976 , the year before Jackson joined the team . ESPN reports Jackson , who attended the auction , bought the letters 'on a lark . ' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters , some of which are also 10-feet-wide , he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself . He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States , he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner 's home . Yankee Stadium : The letters at the stadium , which was built in 1923 , were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 In addition to the letters , Sotheby 's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s . Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $ 20,000 to $ 30,000 , it raked in a winning bid of $ 112,500 at auction .",

An uninspired campaign has seen the Yorkshire side firmly entrenched in mid-table mediocrity in League One . Saturday 's visit of Fleetwood Town , who were eyeing the beach after their play-off hopes had all but evaporated , hardly promised to be a thriller . Doncaster 's League One encounter against Fleetwood tested the patience of the most ardent fan Doncaster 's media team faced a tough challenge compling the match highlights of 0-0 draw And so it proved as the two sides played out a goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium . It left the media team with a bit of a problem when they were faced with sticking up the match highlights on the club 's YouTube channel . So they made it short and sweet , just 27 seconds in fact with 14 seconds of match action . Just enough time for the kick off , a goal kick and the final whistle . A must-see video for all football fans . The managers on the touchline during Saturday 's goalless draw at the Keepmoat Stadium",

On Tuesday , a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker . The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland . The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot 's actions were `` unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed , '' Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said . Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off , according to a Defense Ministry spokesman . Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number . An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false . Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will `` file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels '' with Russia . This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27 . A year ago , a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific , according to U.S. officials who called it `` one of the most dangerous close passes in decades .
