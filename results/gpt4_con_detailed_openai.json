Please calculate the score agian!\n- Consistency: 2\n\nThe summary does state that Steve Bruce wants to keep Hull City in the Premier League and mentions the hope that \"nine or eight might be enough,\" which aligns with the source text. It also correctly notes that Hull has six games left to save their season and mentions the James Ward-Prowse penalty and a late strike from Southampton. The injuries to Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic are mentioned, which is consistent with the source text's discussion of long-term injuries to key players.\n\nHowever, the summary inaccurately implies that the James Ward-Prowse penalty and the late strike from Southampton occurred within the first 45 minutes, which is not supported by the source text. The source text states that Hull were the better side for the first 45 minutes but does not specify when the goals occurred. The summary also fails to mention Graziano Pelle, who scored the late strike, and omits significant details such as Hull's position in the league, the context of their performance over the past three years, and the specific challenges they face in their upcoming fixtures. Additionally, the summary does not include any information about the incident with Sadio Mane and the penalty, Ronald Koeman's response, or the broader context of Hull's season and the challenges they face in their remaining fixtures. These omissions and inaccuracies significantly affect the factual alignment of the summary with the source text, leading to a lower consistency score."

Additionally, the summary omits several details such as the fathers being dressed as salarymen, the setting of the photos in front of Japanese landmarks, and the online interest the series has generated. These omissions do not constitute factual errors but do leave out some context. The summary also does not mention the fathers' expressions, some of which are pained, and the variety in the jumps' intensity.

Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit. The images see the fathers pull energetic poses despite their age with some of the expressions of the older fathers looking slightly pained. Very little else is known about the pictures or why they have come into existence but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online for their curious nature. The 37-year-old's images are said to be part of a book which roughly translates as Daughter and Salaryman Each image sees the daughter stood po-faced as their father makes an energetic leap Some of the older fathers adopt a pained expression as they make their jump Each photograph sees the daughter wearing casual clothing with her father in a sharp suit The pictures see the families pose in front of various Japanese landmarks Very little is known about the set of photos but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online Some of the jumps are more subtle than others with this father opting for a classic jump This young girl can't help but giggle at her dad's ambitious leap This dapper dad adds a peace gesture into his final pose This father can't help but jump for joy in his portrait",

He made off with the dairy's till and about $1500 in cash on Saturday, Stuff.co.nz reports. A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large. They are asking anyone with information that may help to identify this person to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or to message police online.",

Additionally, the summary does not mention any specific incidents or examples of Stokes's fiery character, such as the clash with Marlon Samuels or the locker incident, which are key elements of the source text.

Obesity: Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers, a large-scale study has found (file photo) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription. By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain.

By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese. And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight. Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler. Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics. They were also slightly taller than boys who hadn't been given the drugs. The study didn't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain. But if they do, it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten. This frees up more food for the body. Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys.

'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat.

Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite. Lead author Dr Antti Saari, of Kuopio University Hospital, warned: 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age, or repeatedly during infancy, was associated with increased body mass in healthy children. 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy. The worldwide obesity epidemic is real, and is more pronounced for boys. 'Epidemic': By two years-old, one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight (file photo) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems. 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences.' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems. The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat. The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak.",
        "system_output": "researchers say just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight . the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic . a third of 10-11 year olds in england are overweight or obese . finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy with records . babies given antibiotics in first six months of life are more likely to be fat .",
        "human_score": 5.0,
        "consistency": "- Consistency: 4\n\nThe summary is largely consistent with the source text, maintaining the core message that antibiotics in early life may contribute to obesity in toddlers. However, the summary omits the detail that the study is about two-year-olds and does not mention the gender-specific findings (boys being more prone to weight gain). Additionally, the summary incorrectly suggests that a third of 10-11 year olds are overweight or obese without specifying that this statistic is for England, which could potentially mislead readers about the scope of the data. These omissions and lack of specificity slightly reduce the consistency score."
