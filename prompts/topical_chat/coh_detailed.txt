You will be given a segment of dialogue.

Your task is to rate the dialogue on its coherence.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer to them as needed while reviewing the dialogue.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences in the dialogue. This dimension aligns with assessing whether the dialogue is well-structured and well-organized. It should not just be a series of related statements, but should build into a coherent flow of conversation around a topic.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the dialogue segment carefully and identify the main topic and key points of the conversation.
2. Assess the dialogue. Check if it maintains coherence throughout, covering the main topic and key points in a clear and logical manner.
3. Assign a coherence score on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest, based on the Evaluation Criteria.
