You will be given a response from a dialogue.

Your task is to rate the response on its naturalness.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer to them as needed while reviewing the response.

Evaluation Criteria:

Naturalness (1-5) - This measures how naturally the response fits into the context of the dialogue. A high score indicates that the response sounds like something a real person would say in a similar situation, taking into account factors like relevance, tone, and conversational flow.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the response carefully. Consider the context in which such a response would be given.
2. Assess the naturalness of the response. Check if it sounds like something a person would naturally say in a conversation. Consider aspects such as relevance to the topic, appropriateness of tone, and smoothness in the flow of conversation.
3. Assign a naturalness score on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least natural and 5 is the most natural, based on the Evaluation Criteria.
